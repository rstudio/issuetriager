# issuetriager docker action

<!-- badges: start -->
![package test](https://github.com/rstudio/issuetriager/actions/workflows/check-standard.yml/badge.svg)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of issuetriager is to streamline the triage process for projects that
have frequent issues reported on GitHub. Normal use is inside of a GitHub workflow
that is triggered to run when issues are opened, analyze the text, and use the
results for automatic labeling, closing, or notification about issues.

This action indicates whether the phrase was found within the text or not.

## Inputs

inputs:
  check-phrase:  # id of input
    description: 'A phrase to look for in the text'
    required: true
    default: "I&#39;m stuck because of this issue.: True"
  issue-body:
    description: 'The text body that you want to check for the phrase'
    required: true
    default: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
outputs:
  contains-phrase: # id of output
    description: 'Whether the check phrase was found'

## `check-phrase`

**Required** The phrase to search for in the issue body. Default `"I'm stuck because of this issue.: True"`.

## `issue-body`

**Required** The text body that you want to search for the phrase. Default `"${{ github.event.issue.body }}"`.

## Outputs

## `contains-phrase`

Whether the check phrase was found
